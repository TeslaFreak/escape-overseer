##### Escape room timer and control software. Customizable timer screen can be put on TV/monitor in room and controlled remotely by employees.

##### UPDATE: This project is no longer being supported as of Feb. 2021
## Features
### Customizable In-Room Timer Screen: 
Capable of pausing the timer at any time as well as adjusting the game time on the fly if necessary by quickly adding/subtracting minutes from the current game time. The screen itself is customizable with a background image of your choosing, and adjustable text color and font 

### Clue Counter: 
Keep track of how many clues players have used with the click of a button.

### Send Clues: 
Write clues to send to the players in game along with an alert tone to grab their attention. Any message sent will appear below the timer on the in room monitor. Frequently used clues can also be saved for quick access.

### Intro Videos: 
We know many escape rooms like to play an introductory video before their rooms begin to go over rules or set up the story. Overseer allows you to quickly upload your intro videos and begin each room with the video playing automatically.

### Reporting: 
Keep track of metrics on your rooms. Fill out reports in-app each time a team goes through to measure the escape rate of each of your rooms, as well as the employee running each room. Uncover valuable information like what team sizes work best with each of your rooms or possibly what puzzles are players constantly stuck on that could use refactoring.

## Future Plans

### Voice Recognition and Automated Clue Sending
It can be a pain for room guides to have to constantly be listening to the players audio to make sure they dont miss a clue request, especially if theyre running more than one room at a time or new players have shown up in your lobby and you have to step away from the controls for a minute. This feature will allow for voice recognition so when players speak a key phrase, the system will detect this and (depending on your preference) send a clue automatically or light up an on screen notifiaction for the room guide so they know when a clue has been requested without having to be listening to the audio the entire time.

### Fully Customizable Event Mapping GUI
We already allow for the ability to upload custom intro videos that may be played at the push of a button, but this feature will expand on this and allow you to automatically map out events such as playing audio and video, pushing clues, displaying images, etc. and tie each of these events to a trigger such as a when a particular time has been reached in game or a button has been pushed in the room.
Examples:
Detect that there are 10 seconds left in the game and begin playing a countdown audio file.
Play multiple videos one after the other before starting your timer at the beginning of the game.
Push an image clue to the screen when a particular puzzle has been solved.
