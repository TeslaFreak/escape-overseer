##### Escape room timer and control software. Customizable timer screen can be put on TV/monitor in room and controlled remotely by employees.
## Features
### Timer: 
Capable of pausing the timer at any time as well as adjusting the game time on the fly if necessary by quickly adding/subtracting minutes from the current game time.

### Clue Counter: 
Keep track of how many clues players have used with the click of a button.

### Send Clues: 
Write clues to send to the players in game along with an alert tone to grab their attention. Any message sent will appear below the timer on the in room monitor. Frequently used clues can also be saved for quick access.

### Intro Videos: 
We know many escape rooms like to play an introductory video before their rooms begin to go over rules or set up the story. Overseer allows you to quickly upload your intro videos and begin each room with the video playing automatically.

### Reporting: 
Keep track of metrics on your rooms. Fill out reports in-app each time a team goes through to measure the escape rate of each of your rooms, as well as the employee running each room. Uncover valuable information like what team sizes work best with each of your rooms or possibly what puzzles are players constantly stuck on that could use refactoring.
